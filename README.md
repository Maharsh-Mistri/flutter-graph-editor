# Flutter Interactive Graph Editor üå≥

![App Demo GIF](demo.gif)

> A dynamic and interactive graph and tree visualization application built with Flutter. This app allows users to create, manipulate, and explore tree data structures in real-time on a zoomable and pannable canvas.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dynamic Graph Visualization:** Nodes and edges are laid out automatically using the Buchheim-Walker algorithm from the `graphview` package.
* **Smart Node ID Assignment:** Intelligently finds and reuses the smallest available integer ID for new nodes. If you delete node #3, the next node created will become the new #3.
* **Interactive Canvas:**
    * **Pan:** Click-and-drag or use the mouse scroll wheel to move around the canvas.
    * **Zoom:** Use a two-finger pinch gesture on a trackpad or touchscreen.
* **Full Node Manipulation:**
    * **Add Child Nodes:** Select any node and add children to it.
    * **Delete Nodes:** Delete any node (and its entire subtree) using the button or the 'X' icon.
    * **Reset Tree:** Deleting the root node cleanly resets the entire tree.
* **Real-time Info Display:** The app bar always shows the current maximum depth of the tree.
* **Reset View:** If you get lost on the canvas, a dedicated button instantly re-centers the view.
* **User-Friendly Feedback:** The app provides clear error messages using Snackbars for invalid actions.
